<p>There is currently no official release schedule for the Imba project. If a critical bug has been found
that will warrant a new release, but this will likely change with a formal release schedule when development
activity is back up.</p>
<p>The rest of this page serves as a checklist for the release manager.</p>
<h2>Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Make sure you have run <code>npm build</code>.</li>
<li>[ ] Verify your current version before bumping <code>npm version</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the version looks correct you can proceed by bumping the patch version</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <code>npm version patch</code>, if you want to change the other versions the available options are (<code>major</code>, <code>minor</code>)</li>
<li>[ ] Verify the version looks good by running <code>npm version</code> and with git <code>git tag</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If both look good you can proceed by pushing your changes to GitHub</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] <code>git push origin master &amp;&amp; git push origin --tags</code></li>
<li>[ ] Create release notes that are basically a summary of the output in <code>git log 1.4.3..v1.4.7</code></li>
<li>[ ] Use those release notes on the GitHub releases page.</li>
<li>[ ] Then finally publish to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/imba">npmjs.com</a> by running <code>npm publish</code></li>
<li>[ ] Make a tweet on the @imbajs account</li>
</ul>
